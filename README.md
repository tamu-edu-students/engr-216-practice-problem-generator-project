# Features
* a student can login with the @tamu Google account
* having logged in, a student can choose any category of problem covered in ENGR 216 to practice
* having chosen a category/topic, a student should be shown a randomly generated example problem that uses the selected concept, e.g. momentum balance.
* having been presented with a problem to solve, a student should be able to submit their attempt at a solution (as a final computed numeric value of some initially unknown component).
* having submitted their attempt, a student should get feedback on
  + whether their solution is correct
  + why it is correct / incorrect (reinforcement)
  + how to correct their work
* a student should be able to generate and solve new problems as many times as they like.
* a student should be able to view their "report card", which shows the aggregated/summarized results of all attempts they have made for each category and identifies areas of strength and weakness
* a student should have the option to specify which instructor they have for ENGR 216
* an instructor should be able to see the report card of any student who has opted-in to identifying their instructor as well as a summary report card for all of their students.
